        <h2>Rakesh Jain Memorial Blood Bank Emergency Services</h2>
        <div class="emergency-info">
            <p>The Rakesh Jain Memorial blood bank provides 24 hr service for in-patients, as well as requirements from other hospitals. It is equipped with an ultramodern collection centre, component lab & aphaeresis facility. Blood is made up of formed elements, red cells, leukocytes and platelets suspended in fluid plasma. Each of these components can be separated from whole blood and stored according to its storage requirement. Only indication of whole blood in today’s practice is Exchange Transfusion in neonate. Every other situation demands use of specific components like packed RBCs, FFP or Platelets.</p>
            
            <h3>Components Prepared from Whole Blood:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>RBC Concentrate:</strong> The component is prepared from the whole blood immediately after collection. Minimizes post-transfusion circulatory overload because of its small volume (250 ml), increases Hb quickly, and minimizes transfusion of unnecessary antibodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Random Donor Platelet:</strong> Can be given without ABO compatibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Single Donor Platelet (SDP):</strong> Obtained through Aphaeresis, where Platelets are separated and collected from a single donor, offering advantages like reduced disease transmission and improved storage characteristics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP):</strong> Can be stored at or below -30°C for one year and used for patients with significant coagulopathy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Granulocyte Concentrate:</strong> Role decreased with new antibiotics and granulocyte colony stimulating factors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cryoprecipitate (Cryo):</strong> Derived from FFP, containing cryoprecipitate proteins.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Donor Requirements:</h3>
            <p>To donate blood, individuals should:</p>
